                            The first thing that comes to mind when playing The Last of Us, is just how far games have come since the days of tank controls and blocky pixels running to and from on screen.<br> To put it lightly, The Last of Us is a masterpiece
                            that so poignantly depicts how the apocalypse would affect the world, but more importantly the people in it. You can really feel the loss and the desperation of the people you come into contact with, and the sheer level of
                            polish and raw heartfelt emotion found at its core shows that Naughty Dog are one of the the greatest game developers of this generation.<br> The storytelling is extraordinary, but it plays second fiddle to the truly exceptional
                            character development and gameplay that is found therein. From the pulse-pounding stealth mechanics, and the tightly refined crafting system, to the weighty close quarters combat and the risk reward loop that comes hand-in-hand
                            with the ranged combat and inventory management typically found in most survival-horror games.<br> Overall, I can't give this game enough praise and if you haven't yet played this game, then I envy you, as you have the eopportunity
                            to experience this astonishing experience from start to finish through fresh eyes.

                        <p class="text">
                            Now what is there to say about the game that was dubbed to be the "Destiny killer"...<br> Visually, it certainly is astonishing! And when you actually do get to play the game, it can be a real treat (but more on that later).
                            The question on everyone's lips though, is "does anthem live up to the hype?"<br> Put simply...NO! The game does so many things well, but for every one good thing the game does, it has a habit of taking one (sometimes two)
                            step/s in all the wrong directions. Nothing displays this more than the feeling you get when you equip one of the 4 Javelin (think Iron Man) suits, customise it with a choice of weapons, offensive/support gear, components and
                            even cosmetic armour pieces and then finally load into the mission launch screen. More so is the feeling you get once you've loaded into the "open" world and leap from the side of Fort Tarsis, then with a swift click of L3,
                            your thrusters are activated and you off soaring through the clouds...kinda.<br> See, this is where Anthem starts to show its cracks, as its doesn't matter how good the mountains in the backdrop really look, when the verticality
                            of the game is stunted by a fairly low invisible ceiling. Not to say that the flying isn't great, because Bioware have really nailed the feeling of effortlessly gliding and dodging, so much so, that it's almost hard to belive
                            its taken this long to achieve such a feeling in a game.<br> The flaws do mount up though, from the current lack of endgame content, to the infinite number of loading screens, to the far more serious issue wherein the game
                            has caused consoles to crash (with no major lasting effects mind.)<br> All in all, id say this game has a lot of potential, and the developers are providing the game with rapid support in the form of patches and bug fixes.
                            Whether this will be enough to keep people coming back to Anthem has yet to be seen, but I can only hope that Bioware manage to keep their fans on board long enough for them to introduce more meaningul engame content and the
                            free DLC that they have planned further down the line.

                            If you are news to the soulsborne series, then this game will be a brutal awakening to the sadistic gameplay loop of "Fight, Die, Learn, Repeat" that FromSoftware has perfected over the 3 games prior to Bloodborne. For those that have experienced the
                            previous titles, this will be yet another journey into familiar territory, with but one major difference...<br> The combat! Or more accurately, the pace therein when engaging with one of the games
                            many difficult enemies/bosses. Whereas the previous titles (Demon/Dark Souls) would reward you for patience and blocking heavily during combat, Bloodborne takes a far more aggressive approach that encourages you to learn on
                            the fly when encountering the many residents of Yharnam.<br> The game starts with you as a Hunter journeying to Yharnam seeking paleblood, however upon arrival it becomes apparent that an illness has transformed most of Yharnam
                            into beast-like creatures. The story past this point is up to the player to find out through lore and exploring the world. The story isn't what keeps your coming back to the Gothic Victorian era inspired locales though! As
                            the main draw to the game is the feeling of dread and aticipation that hangs thick in the air everytime you step foot into a new area or face a new boss.<br> Learning to use (and master) Bloodborne's combat system of dodging
                            and parrying will take some getting used to, and the inclusion of the new Regain/Rally system (a risk/reward style function that allows you to regain health lost when hit by an attack, by reacting quickly and attacking back
                            before the health has actually depleted from the health bar) really does set this game apart from the previous intallments.

                            The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is Nintendo finally bringing one of its best loved series into the modern age of gaming.<br> For the last two generations the Zelda franchise has stuck to the same formula first popularised
                            by The Ocarina of Time. Typically a player is introduced to a large over world with multiple dungeons that must be solved. In doing so the player unlocks additional skills and items that then allow them to complete more dungeons.
                            Each of the games since OoT have offered a variation on the theme such as Wind Waker's sailing mechanics or the ability to transform into a world as seen in Twilight Princess. It proved a successful formula but it never pushed
                            the franchise outside of its comfort zone.<br> An often forgotten flaw in these adventures masterpieces is the dreary and slow introduction to the basics. Each game of the 3D era has felt the need to force the player through
                            a gauntlet of menial tasks to ensure they understand the core mechanics and controls. This could be great for new or returning players but for many an option to skip would of been the preferred option.<br> For Breath of the
                            Wild Nintendo has looked back to the era of 8-bit and 16-bit Zelda and in doing so has unshackled players from the restrictions of modern entries in the series. Breath of the Wild is the biggest, most open entry in the series
                            to date. Not since A Link to the Past has a Zelda game respected the players intelligence and implicitly.<br> This doesn't mean there isn't a tutorial of sorts to be found,in fact Breath of the Wild may have one of the best
                            introductions to any game of the last decade. In an unprecedented move, every major item and tool needed is acquired within the first hour of the game. The Great Plateau, the first area a player encounters, is a condensed version
                            of the entire map. It allows the player to explore varied terrain, experience most of what the weather system has to offer and rewards experimentation of the physics system introduced in this game.<br> After acquiring a certain
                            item you are able to leave the Great Plateau and for the first time in a long time I felt a sense of wonder and uncertainty of how I should solve the great puzzle that is Hyrule. The world of Hyrule is directionless to an extent,
                            you can go anywhere and do anything after leaving the Plateau. This includes challenging the final boss but that would be to miss out on everything the game has to offer, that and you'll most likely die a death. Without question,
                            to me this is the hardest Zelda game there has been in the last 20 years.<br> There isn't a typical RPG structure in place but areas of the game are scaled to different difficulties. Often there is no indication of this to
                            a new player, enemies small and large appear in most areas and are capable of catching even an experienced player off guard. The first indicator that you are under prepared for an area is when an enemy lands a hit. Sometime
                            they may take a quarter of a heart, other areas they will take five whole hearts. If you die then the game will intelligently respawn you near to, but not in danger of what justed ended your existence. This allows the player
                            to learn from their mistakes and either leave the area to fight another day or fight the good fight once more.<br> Comparisons will inevitably be made to the king of lock on combat, Dark Souls but I feel this is unfair. Since
                            Ocarina of Time the Zelda franchise has implemented a variation of its Z targeting system. If anything Dark Souls is the horror and blood drenched love letter to the foundations that Zelda Laid down. Unlike Dark Souls, Breath
                            of the Wild does not punish death. You lose no items or progress and this allows you to experiment to a degree.<br> being prepared for a new area means stocking up and thankfully healing items are found all over the world.
                            Many of them can be combined into better meals that give additional bonuses but the system has issues. The problem with cooking is that you are told nothing about the system. It's the one aspect of the game that is entirely
                            reliant on experimentation that could benefit from some explanation as cooking can make the early game more forgiving and allow more risky exploration.<br> All of this may seem overwhelming to a new player but you settle into
                            a rhythm of conquering towers, solving shrines, beating bad guys and cooking succulent banana dishes. This all ties back into the philosophy of Breath of the Wild, freedom of choice. Gone is the rigidity and formulaic gameplay
                            loop of previous entries and in its place is the ability to play in your own way and in the order you want.<br> This isn't to say that the game has been stripped of its identity. You still play as Link, a young Hylian who must
                            save Zelda and defeat Gannon. You still inhabit the world of Hyrule and you still encounter many of the races first seen in older games. The game opens with Link awakening in a shrine suffering from amnesia. The world is not
                            one he recognises, desolate and destroyed with hints of a past civilisation lingering everywhere you look.<br> This setup allows for the normal Zelda story to play out but Nintendo have expanded on many of the relationships
                            and dynamics. The game has a surprising number of implied stories and relationships that draw you into the characters and on several occasions made me feel for their losses, hopes and goals. Some of the changes to key characters
                            like Zelda feel very much necessary, removing the antiquated damsel in distress trope and in its place make her a character of both great intelligence and tragedy.<br> Artistically Breath of the Wild blends the cell shaded
                            beauty of the Wind Waker HD with the soft character models of Skyward Sword to deliver a breathtaking visual presentation. Visually stunning and striking, hues of Studio Ghibli or watercolour animation shine in most moments
                            of the game. Looking over the valleys and mountains, staring into the heart of a volcano or watching light dance on the surface of a lake all feel like a tiny moment from an animated film. All of this beauty is brought to life
                            by a beautiful score capable of mixing the elegance of the world with the haunting reality of a civilisation lost to war. The music can switch from soft melodies to haunting highs at a moment's notice but it never feels put
                            of place.<br> Realistically Nintendo could of plastered this artistic vision over the traditional formula and called it a day. That game would probably of still been brilliant and interesting because of the portability factor
                            of the Switch. The important thing is they didn't though.<br> Breath of the Wild is the first game to show that Zelda and by extension Nintendo has evolved. They are finally willing to move on from a structure that has been
                            used for far too long. Its an admission that they can trust their players and treat them as intelligent individuals. Returning the franchise to its roots as an open world game has ironically made the game feel modern and dynamic.
                            For the 100 hours I played this game, not once did I feel like the soul of Zelda was lost in translation and that is a credit to just how spectacular this first entry in a new start really is.<br>

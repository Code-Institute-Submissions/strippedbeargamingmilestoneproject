                                <p class="text text-center">Review by: Martin Crowley</p>

                                    The first thing that comes to mind when playing The Last of Us, is just how far games have come since the days of tank controls and blocky pixels running to and from on screen.<br>
                                    To put it lightly, The Last of Us is a masterpiece and the level of polish and raw heartfelt emotion found at its core shows that Naughty Dog are one of the the greatest game developers of this generation.<br>
                                    The storytelling is extraordinary, but it plays second fiddle to the truly exceptional character development and gameplay that is found therein.
                                    From the pulse-pounding stealth mechanics, and the tightly refined crafting system, to the weighty close quarters combat and the risk reward loop that comes hand-in-hand with the ranged combat and inventory management typically found in most survival-horror games.<br>
                                    Overall, I can't give this game enough praise and if you haven't yet played this game, then I envy you, as you have the eopportunity to experience this astonishing experience from start to finish through fresh eyes.

                            The first thing that comes to mind when playing The Last of Us, is just how far games have come since the days of tank controls and blocky pixels running to and from on screen.<br> To put it lightly, The Last of Us is a masterpiece
                            that so poignantly depicts how the apocalypse would affect the world, but more importantly the people in it. You can really feel the loss and the desperation of the people you come into contact with, and the sheer level of
                            polish and raw heartfelt emotion found at its core shows that Naughty Dog are one of the the greatest game developers of this generation.<br> The storytelling is extraordinary, but it plays second fiddle to the truly exceptional
                            character development and gameplay that is found therein. From the pulse-pounding stealth mechanics, and the tightly refined crafting system, to the weighty close quarters combat and the risk reward loop that comes hand-in-hand
                            with the ranged combat and inventory management typically found in most survival-horror games.<br> Overall, I can't give this game enough praise and if you haven't yet played this game, then I envy you, as you have the eopportunity
                            to experience this astonishing experience from start to finish through fresh eyes.

                        <p class="text">
                            Now what is there to say about the game that was dubbed to be the "Destiny killer"...<br> Visually, it certainly is astonishing! And when you actually do get to play the game, it can be a real treat (but more on that later).
                            The question on everyone's lips though, is "does anthem live up to the hype?"<br> Put simply...NO! The game does so many things well, but for every one good thing the game does, it has a habit of taking one (sometimes two)
                            step/s in all the wrong directions. Nothing displays this more than the feeling you get when you equip one of the 4 Javelin (think Iron Man) suits, customise it with a choice of weapons, offensive/support gear, components and
                            even cosmetic armour pieces and then finally load into the mission launch screen. More so is the feeling you get once you've loaded into the "open" world and leap from the side of Fort Tarsis, then with a swift click of L3,
                            your thrusters are activated and you off soaring through the clouds...kinda.<br> See, this is where Anthem starts to show its cracks, as its doesn't matter how good the mountains in the backdrop really look, when the verticality
                            of the game is stunted by a fairly low invisible ceiling. Not to say that the flying isn't great, because Bioware have really nailed the feeling of effortlessly gliding and dodging, so much so, that it's almost hard to belive
                            its taken this long to achieve such a feeling in a game.<br> The flaws do mount up though, from the current lack of endgame content, to the infinite number of loading screens, to the far more serious issue wherein the game
                            has caused consoles to crash (with no major lasting effects mind.)<br> All in all, id say this game has a lot of potential, and the developers are providing the game with rapid support in the form of patches and bug fixes.
                            Whether this will be enough to keep people coming back to Anthem has yet to be seen, but I can only hope that Bioware manage to keep their fans on board long enough for them to introduce more meaningul engame content and the
                            free DLC that they have planned further down the line.

                            If you are news to the soulsborne series, then this game will be a brutal awakening to the sadistic gameplay loop of "Fight, Die, Learn, Repeat" that FromSoftware has perfected over the 3 games prior to Bloodborne. For those that have experienced the
                            previous titles, this will be yet another journey into familiar territory, with but one major difference...<br> The combat! Or more accurately, the pace therein when engaging with one of the games
                            many difficult enemies/bosses. Whereas the previous titles (Demon/Dark Souls) would reward you for patience and blocking heavily during combat, Bloodborne takes a far more aggressive approach that encourages you to learn on
                            the fly when encountering the many residents of Yharnam.<br> The game starts with you as a Hunter journeying to Yharnam seeking paleblood, however upon arrival it becomes apparent that an illness has transformed most of Yharnam
                            into beast-like creatures. The story past this point is up to the player to find out through lore and exploring the world. The story isn't what keeps your coming back to the Gothic Victorian era inspired locales though! As
                            the main draw to the game is the feeling of dread and aticipation that hangs thick in the air everytime you step foot into a new area or face a new boss.<br> Learning to use (and master) Bloodborne's combat system of dodging
                            and parrying will take some getting used to, and the inclusion of the new Regain/Rally system (a risk/reward style function that allows you to regain health lost when hit by an attack, by reacting quickly and attacking back
                            before the health has actually depleted from the health bar) really does set this game apart from the previous intallments.

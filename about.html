                                I have always been into gaming for as long as I can remember. From playing Crash Bandicoot on the Playstation (PS1), to the original Pokemon games on the Gameboy.<br> However, my real passion for gaming started when I first
                                sat with my dad watching him play Metal Gear Solid on the PS1, and staring with wide eyed wonder at how amazing the game looked and how easy he seemed to make it appear as he breezed through difficult sections with ease.<br>                                One point that really sticks in my mind though was when we encountered the trippy Psycho Mantis boss fight in MGS1, and he could actively "read your mind" through your save files (on your memory card) and predict your next
                                moves because of it. This gimmick made the fight next to impossible (later realising there was an easter egg in the game tht involved changing your controller to the 2nd controller slot, which would negate this mechanic
                                from occuring), yet my dad did the entire fight the hard way. I remeber him coming into the kitchen the next morning, after pulling an all-nighter to achieve the feat, with his face showing a whole range of emotion. From
                                relief, to excitement, and even low-key defeat, after the realisation clicked in that a video game had robbed him of so many hours that previous night.<br> This...This is what caused me to fall in love with gaming! The
                                range of emotions! From the exhileration felt after completeing a hard segment of a game, to the frustration you feel when you die shortly afterwards and have to repeat the entire section all over again. The feeling of
                                relief when the character you've just spent 30+ hours getting attached to, actually manages to make it to the end credits.<br> This has lead to video games/gaming playing a considerable role in my life and even being the
                                platform through which I have made some amazing friendships with people of different ages, from all over the world. One of who is also part of this game reviewing dynamic duo, as seen below...
